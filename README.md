## About The Game

**The Quota Must Be Met.**

You are trapped in a cursed maze with one goal: escape. But the exit demands a price—a constantly increasing **quota** of gold that you must gather from the labyrinth's treacherous halls.

This is a top-down roguelike where every decision matters. Each coin you snatch from the darkness comes with a risk. Will you be blessed with fortune, or will you trigger a debilitating curse that makes your escape that much harder?

## Key Features

*   🎲 **Risk vs. Reward:** Every coin collected has a chance to apply a random debuff! From slowing your movement and dimming your vision to teleporting you across the map or sealing the path behind you, every treasure comes with a price.
*   🧠 **Intelligent Enemies:** Face two types of foes! A basic goblin that guards its territory and a relentless, intelligent hunter that awakens only when your pockets are heavy with gold, using A* pathfinding to navigate the maze.
*   💥 **A Dynamic, Treacherous Maze:** The dungeon itself is your enemy. Step on hidden mines to blow permanent holes in the floor, creating new obstacles for you and your pursuers. Navigate crumbling platforms that break after a single step.
*   💡 **Wield the Light:** You are not defenseless. Use your coins to strategically place and retrieve torches, illuminating the path and giving you a moment of safety.
*   🧱 **Forge Your Own Path:** Can't find a way through? Spend your hard-earned coins to break down walls or repair broken floors, creating new shortcuts and escape routes.
*   💀 **High-Stakes Death:** When you fall, you drop a pouch containing all your gold. Will you risk a "corpse run" back into danger to retrieve your fortune? Every death leaves a new pouch, a monument to your failures.
*   🎁 **Treacherous Treasures:** Find chests that could contain a wealth of coins, a life-saving heart, or a deadly mimic!
